### Notes from rocca:
 * ONNX model file (about 17mb) is served from this Hugging Face repo: https://huggingface.co/rocca/informative-drawings-line-art-onnx
 * The notebook I used to convert the model to ONNX is here: https://colab.research.google.com/josephrocca/image-to-line-art-js/blob/main/Informative_Drawings_Line_Art_Generator_ONNX_conversion.ipynb
