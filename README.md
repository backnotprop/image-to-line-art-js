# Image to line art / sketch in JavaScript with ONNX

This is a simple demo of a JavaScript port of this model: https://huggingface.co/spaces/carolineec/informativedrawings (all credit for this goes to the author of that model)

**Try it here**: https://josephrocca.github.io/image-to-line-art-js

ONNX model file (about 17mb) is served from this Hugging Face repo: https://huggingface.co/rocca/informative-drawings-line-art-onnx

The notebook I used to convert the model to ONNX is here: https://colab.research.google.com/josephrocca/image-to-line-art-js/blob/main/Informative_Drawings_Line_Art_Generator_ONNX_conversion.ipynb
